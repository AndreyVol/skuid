Code Samples
=================

To get started coding your own custom Skuid components, we recommend you start here:
[Creating a Custom Skuid Component](/skuid/devcreatecomponent.html)

Next, take a look at the code for this sample [Map component](/skuid/samplemap.html).

We'll be adding some more in-depth explanations of Skuid Component syntax very soon, as well as the code from the Calendar component included in the Skuid core (not yet released --- stay tuned!)
