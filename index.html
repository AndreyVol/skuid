Skuid Developer Guide
=================

Welcome to Skuid, the future of custom user interface development on Force.com.

## Audience
This documentation is designed for people familiar with JavaScript programming 
and object-oriented programming concepts. You should also be familiar with 
the Apex programming language and developing on the Force.com Platform.

## Skuid Overview
For an overview of what Skuid does and how to use it, we recommend watching the [Skuid Demo](http://www.skoodat.com/Skuid).

In a nutshell, Skuid lets you quickly create custom user interfaces for Force.com using a drag-and-drop GUI page builder. These interfaces, stored in Page object records within your Force.com org, can then be used as overrides for standard or custom object actions, such as the Account Tab, Edit Contact page, New Lead page, Clone Opportunity page, etc.

You can also use Skuid to build standalone pages that you link to from other pages, such as a custom wizard for converting a lead or mass-editing multiple related objects at once. We're sure you'll think of uses we never dreamed of!
