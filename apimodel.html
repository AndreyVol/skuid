skuid.model Object
=================
The skuid.model object provides a mechanism for communicating with the 
force.com database. Models are defined using the Skuid page builder and can be
accessed and manipulated using this API.
## Classes
### Model Class
#### Constructor
Use `skuid.model.getModel( modelId )` to retrieve an instance of a model where 
`modelId` is the id given to the model in the page builder.
#### Prototype Methods
##### `getFieldValue( row, field )`
Returns the value for a particular field in a row from this model. Use model 
methods that return rows such as `getFirstRow()` to retrieve an instance of a row.
##### `getField( fieldName )`
Returns a Javascript object representing a field in this model where `fieldName` 
is the API name of the field requested.
##### `getFirstRow()`
Returns the first row in this model.
##### `getRowById( id )`
Returns the row in this model identified by the given `id`.
##### `updateData( callback )`
Requests an update for this model from the server. An optional callback can
be sent in and it will be run after the update is complete.
##### `createRow( options )`
Creates a new row and attaches it to this model. If options.doAppend is set,
the row will be added as the last row of the model instead of the first row.
##### `updateRow( row, field, value )`
Updates the value of the data for the given row and field, 
then notifies all registered Ui elements that changes took place. 
Changes made will *not* be sent to the server until the `save()` method is called.
##### `updateRow( row, {field1: value1, ... [, fieldN: valueN ] } )`
Allows for making updates to multiple fields on a given row all at once,
instead of having to make the updates one by one.
##### `deleteRow( row )`
Marks the given row for deletion. This will not be sent to the server until
the `save()` method is called.
##### `undeleteRow( row )`
Unmarks the given row for deletion. This will not be sent to the server until
the `save()` method is called.
##### `cancel()`
Reverts all changes made to this model since it was last saved or updated.
##### `save()`
Sends all changes to this model to the server.
##### `getConditionByName(conditionName, [searchSubConditions])`
Searches this Model for a Condition with the requested name, 
optionally searching sub conditions as well, and returns the Condition.
##### `setCondition(condition,value,[affectCookies])`
Sets the value of a Condition on the Model, where Condition is an object,
which should be retrieved using `getConditionByName`.
If affectCookies is explicitly set to true, and this Condition has a name,
then a corresponding session Cookie will be created or updated with this new value.
##### `activateCondition(condition,[affectCookies])`
Sets the 'inactive' property on a Condition to false, where Condition is an object,
which should be retrieved using `getConditionByName`.
If affectCookies is explicitly set to true, and this Condition has a name,
then a corresponding session Cookie will have its value set to '-on-'
##### `deactivateCondition(condition,[affectCookies])`
Sets the 'inactive' property on a Condition to true, where Condition is an object,
which should be retrieved using `getConditionByName`.
If affectCookies is explicitly set to true, and this Condition has a name,
then a corresponding session Cookie will have its value set to '-off-'
#### Examples

{% highlight javascript %}
// Get an instance of one of the models from the page metadata
var mymodel = skuid.model.getModel('ExampleModel');

// Get the first row of the model
var firstrow = mymodel.getFirstRow();
{% endhighlight %}

## Methods
##### `getModel( modelId )`
Returns an instance of the model corresponding to the given `id`.
##### `isNewId( id )`
Returns a boolean depending on whether the id requested is an existing Salesforce
id or a new temporary id.
##### `save( models )`
Sends all changes for the given models to the server.
##### `updateData( models, callback )`
Requests an update for the given models from the server. An optional callback
can be sent in and it will be run after the updates are complete.
