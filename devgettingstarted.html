Welcome to Skuid, the future of custom user interface development on Force.com.

##Using Skuid
###Skuid Overview
For an overview of what Skuid does and how to use it, we recommend watching the [Skuid Demo](http://www.skoodat.com/Skuid).
In a nutshell, Skuid lets you quickly create custom user interfaces for Force.com using a drag-and-drop GUI page builder. These interfaces, stored in Page object records within your Force.com org, can then be used as overrides for standard or custom object actions, such as the Account Tab, Edit Contact page, New Lead page, Clone Opportunity page, etc.

You can also use Skuid to build standalone pages that you link to from other pages, such as a custom wizard for converting a lead or mass-editing multiple related objects at once. We're sure you'll think of uses we never dreamed of!

###Your first Skuid Pages
A great way to get started with Skuid is to follow these tutorials. The first two tutorials will guide you step by step through creating pages to use in place of the Account Tab and Account Detail page actions. The third tutorial will show you how to actually implement these pages as overrides for those actions.

###Using Skuid in your AppExchange Apps (Managed Packages)
As a Force.com ISV (a developer of custom applications for Salesforce.com users), you can actually include Skuid, and your custom Skuid interfaces, right inside of your package! To do this, you'll need to [create a Skuid module](http://plusplusben.github.com/skuid/devcreatemodule.html).

###Extending Skuid / Creating custom components
Although we will be continue to add additional core Skuid components over time, we've made it easy for *you* to create your own Skuid components. To get started, check out our guide to [creating custom Skuid components](http://plusplusben.github.com/skuid/devcreatecomponent.html), as well as the sample [custom map component](http://plusplusben.github.com/skuid/devcreatecomponent.html) on our Github repo.
